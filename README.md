## Presentation 

*This is a prototype version of PING. PING is curently in developpment.*

PING (Ping Is Not Googledocs) is a numeric tool for sharing notes taking in real time, without disturbing note takers. PING allows a personal note taking, and at the same time, a visualization of others' notes. 
The goal of this polling is to produce a common and shareable document, increased by everyone's work. 
PING's challenge is to modify the way we are taking notes and the way we are sharing knowledges by putting forward the knowledge of everyone.
The audience is not a simple consummer of a speach, but we are its co creator. We are active and enriched by collective knowledges.
